# Overview
Welcome! PhyloCloud is an easy-to-use online platform for operating and interpreting phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments, serving as a bridge between complex phylogenomic frameworks and non-expert users. Users can browse the public tree collections or build and save your own trees at your own workplace both registerially and anonymously

# Quick Start
 PhyloCloud provides entry point to annotated data and tools for phylogenomic research, regardless of whether registered or anonymous users. The home page of PhyloCloud indicates the most typical features so you can quickly start using PhyloCloud:

 - [Upload and visualize trees](#uploadtree) , registerially or anonymously
 - [Build your phylogenies](#buildtree)  by just one click
 - [Browse and search](#searchtree) public tree collection

Besides of common usage for trees management, we also provide various phylogenetic tools to conduct various analysis

 - [Compare tree topologies](#comparetree)
 - [Tree annotation](#annotatetree) with taxonomic information
 - [Query taxonomy databases](#taxaquery) 

## UploadTree
One of the core features in PhyloCloud is to allow user upload multiple trees as a collection. Click the [Upload tree](https://phylocloud.cgmlab.org/) button at the top right corner of the page to open the upload panel.
